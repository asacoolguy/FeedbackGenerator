1.1	It was such a joy to work with Baobao today. Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to serve you by showing you our VIPKID program. We had a great class, and Baobao had a positive and pleasant attitude and was a joy to work with. The first part of class was used to determine what level would be best for Baobao. Then, we worked through the Level 2 Complete Beginner Lesson. Today we learned "What is your name?" "My name is Baobao". "How old are you?" "I am 7". and reviewed the A, B, C’s. We learned big and small letters. Baobao also practiced answering questions like: What is your name? How old are you? As Baobao enrolls in the VIPKID program and continues to work with a native-English teacher, I know they will gain more confidence, growing in both verbal communication skills as well as advanced reading skills. At VIPKID, we work very hard with our students to ensure they not only learn English well, but that they also enjoy their time learning and practicing it. We hope you will give us the opportunity to help Baobao grow in understanding and practicing the English language by enrolling in our VIPKID program. Thank you again for the privilege of having us work with your child today!  If you enjoyed the lesson, please consider leaving me feedback, too.  Thank you! -Teacher Grace
1.2	It was such a joy to work with Baobao today. Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to serve you by showing you our VIPKID program. We had a great class, and Baobao had a positive and pleasant attitude. The first part of class was used to determine what level would be best for Baobao.  He is a very advanced student, so I placed him in Level 5. Then, we worked through part of a lesson. Baobao can read so well; he can also converse with the teacher fluently and describe people, things, and places.  He seems very confident too, and not afraid to make mistakes!  He only ever made small grammar mistakes, which I would then correct and have him repeat.  I was very impressed with Baobao’s English ability!  As he enrolls in the VIPKID program and continues to work with an English speaking VIPKID teacher, he will grow more in both verbal communication skills as well as advanced reading skills. At VIPKID, we work very hard with our students to ensure they not only learn English well, but that they also enjoy their time learning and practicing it. We hope you will give us the opportunity to help Baobao grow in understanding and practicing the English language by enrolling in our VIPKID program. Thank you again for the privilege of teaching Baobao today!  - Teacher Grace
